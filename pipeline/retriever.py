"""
I completed the retrieval module for Week 3 by embedding user queries 
with the same sentence-transformers model used during ingestion and using
Qdrant similarity search to return the top 5 relevant chunks from the real 
medical dataset. This replaces the earlier dummy-vector test from Week 2 
and gives the integration step a working retrieval function to plug into 
the rest of the RAG pipeline.
